# Simon-s-MFA-project
My project will present a guided, immersive style performance that explores the use of exemplar methods of using accessible digital technology (in the areas of digital projection and interactive visual programming) in a live production environment. 
The project is also looking at the impact this access is having on scenic design for low budget theatre.
